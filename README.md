# Word Ladder Console App
Word Ladder Console app, by Ricardo Raposo.

This console application uses the WordLadderSolver library, to solve a word ladder of the choice of the user.

The application asks the user for the following input parameters:
First word, of the word ladder
Last word, of the word ladder
File path of the word dictionary to be used in the word ladder

After receiving and validating the parameters, the application will use the WordLadderSolver library to solve the word ladder, if possible.

The library used is available in this repository: https://github.com/R-Raposo/WordLadderSolver

Currently, this console application references the WordLadderSolver library via a NuGet Package.
If you wish to see the source code of the library, you must clone the https://github.com/R-Raposo/WordLadderSolver repository.
